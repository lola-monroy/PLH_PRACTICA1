# PLH_PRACTICA1 - Linguistic Processing Practice

## Project Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for the first practical assignment in the "Procesamiento del Lenguaje Humano" (PLH) course. The practice focuses on natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including text preprocessing, tokenization, and linguistic analysis.

## Features
- Text preprocessing: cleaning, normalization, and tokenization.
- Implementation of basic linguistic processing tasks.
- Analysis of linguistic features using Python-based libraries.
- Support for multiple languages in text processing.
  
## Prerequisites
To run the project, you will need the following:
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lola-monroy/PLH_PRACTICA1.git
    ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd PLH_PRACTICA1
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. To start the text preprocessing tasks, run:
    ```bash
    python preprocess_text.py
    ```
2. To analyze the linguistic features of the text, run:
    ```bash
    python analyze_text.py
    ```

## Project Structure
- `data/` : Contains text data used for analysis.
- `src/` : Contains the main scripts for text preprocessing and analysis.
- `notebooks/` : Jupyter notebooks with additional explanations and visualizations of the text analysis.
- `requirements.txt` : Lists the dependencies required for the project.
